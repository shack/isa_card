# KiCad ISA Card Symbols and Footprints

Built on the default KiCad symbols and footprints.
We are using them for PCBs building a homebrew 8-bit computer.
The symbols come with preassigned clock and reset pins and have the standard ISA pin names removed.

There are symbols and footprints for the "8-bit" card standard (62 pins) and the "16-bit" card standard (98 pins).

The footprints have the standard maximal measures described in the standard on the F.Fab layer and the board border at the pins on the Edge.Cuts layer.
The corners are rounded so that they match the fabrication limitations of the common manufacturers.
